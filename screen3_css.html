	<h4>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h4>
	<p> <span>PPC</span>(<a href="">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>PPC Automation</span> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
		<li><span>PPC Management</span> - <a href="">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and priortization of <a href="">paid search</a> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assingning each item on as seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <a href="">online ad campaign</a>.</li>
